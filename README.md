# Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this task was to perform structured data analysis using SQL. The focus was on writing queries to extract insights from an eCommerce database and demonstrate understanding of SQL fundamentals, joins, subqueries, views, and query optimization.

## Files Included
- `queries.sql` – Contains all the SQL queries used for analysis
- `summary.pdf` – PDF with query outputs and explanation
- `screenshots/` – Folder with screenshots of query results (optional)
- `README.md` – This file

## Key Concepts Applied
- SELECT statements with WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY clauses
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN operations
- Subqueries for nested data extraction
- Aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, and AVG
- Created SQL Views for reusable analysis
- Basic indexing techniques to optimize queries

## Dataset
- Used a sample eCommerce SQL dataset which includes tables such as:
  - Customers
  - Orders
  - Order_Details
  - Products
  - Categories

## Summary of Analysis
- Identified top-selling products by total revenue
- Calculated average order value by customer
- Analyzed sales by category and month
- Retrieved inactive customers using subqueries
- Created views to monitor key metrics like monthly revenue
- Demonstrated joins to combine customer and order data efficiently

## Tools Used
- MySQL (local installation)
- SQL Editor (like MySQL Workbench / DB Browser for SQLite)
- PDF Editor for result compilation

## Outcome
This task improved understanding of querying relational databases, applying joins and subqueries, and using SQL for real-world business data analysis. It also provided hands-on experience with writing efficient and reusable SQL code.
